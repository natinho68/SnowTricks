        description: "This awesome grab will really show off your mastery of the park but is easy to achieve. In the sixth of Ninja Academy’s snowboard skills series, Matt Barlow demonstrates how. If you have basic grabs down, such as the indy grab (where you grab the toe-side edge between the feet with your back hand) then you’re ready to work your way up the board and try a nose grab. For this trick it’s crucial to focus on bringing the nose of the board to your hand rather than trying to reach down for the board – bending your front leg and straightening your rear leg will bring the tip of the board towards you.Once you’re comfortable with this move, try reversing it for a tail grab. This time pull the board up by bending your back leg and straightening your front leg, then grab the tail of the board with your back hand. Be prepared Approach the jump in a relaxed position, slightly on your toe edge with knees and ankles flexed.Pop up Straighten your knees and ankles and pop off the lip of the jump. Bend & stretch When in the air, bend your front knee into your body while straightening your back leg. Grab it Take hold of the tip of the board with your front hand and spot your landing. Hold on Maintain your position in the air and prepare to land. Stomp it Release the nose and level the board. Absorb the landing with your knees and ankles. Ninja tip Get your board close enough by imagining that you’re trying to knee yourself in the chest."

    Rodeo:
        name: Front Side Rodeo
        author: 4
        description: "The basic frontside rodeo is all together a 540. It essentially falls into a grey area between an off axis frontside 540 and a frontside 180 with a back flip blended into it. The grab choice and different line and pop factors can make it more flipy or more of an off-axis spin. Frontside rodeo can be done off the heels or toes and with a little more spin on the Z Axis can go to 720 or 900. It is possible to do it to a 1080 but, if there is too much flip in the spin, it can be hard not to over flip when going past 720 and 900. The bigger the Z Axis spin, the later the inverted part of the rotation should be. Gaining control on big spin rodeos, may lead to a double cork or a second flip rotation in the spin, if the rider has developed a comfort level with double flips on the tramp or other gymnastic environment.;Rodeo flip; frontside rodeo: A frontward-flipping frontside spin done off the toe-edge. Most commonly performed with a 540° rotation, but also performed as a 720°, 900°, etc.."

        description: "Spins are corked or corkscrew when the axis of the spin allows for the snowboarder to be oriented sideways or upside-down in the air, typically without becoming completely inverted (though the head and shoulders should drop below the relative position of the board). A Double-Cork refers to a rotation in which a snowboarder inverts or orients himself sideways at two distinct times during an aerial rotation. David Benedek is the originator of the Double-Cork in the Half-pipe, but the Double-Cork is also a very common trick in Big-Air competitions. Shaun White is known for making this trick famous in the half-pipe. Several snowboarders have recently extended the limits of technical snowboarding by performing triple-cork variations, Torstein Horgmo being the first to land one in competition. Mark McMorris originated Backside Triple-Cork 1440's in 2011. In 2015 Billy Morgan demonstrated a quadruple cork."
