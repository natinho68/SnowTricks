        description: "This awesome grab will really show off your mastery of the park but is easy to achieve. In the sixth of Ninja Academy’s snowboard skills series, Matt Barlow demonstrates how. If you have basic grabs down, such as the indy grab (where you grab the toe-side edge between the feet with your back hand) then you’re ready to work your way up the board and try a nose grab. For this trick it’s crucial to focus on bringing the nose of the board to your hand rather than trying to reach down for the board – bending your front leg and straightening your rear leg will bring the tip of the board towards you.Once you’re comfortable with this move, try reversing it for a tail grab. This time pull the board up by bending your back leg and straightening your front leg, then grab the tail of the board with your back hand. Be prepared Approach the jump in a relaxed position, slightly on your toe edge with knees and ankles flexed.Pop up Straighten your knees and ankles and pop off the lip of the jump. Bend & stretch When in the air, bend your front knee into your body while straightening your back leg. Grab it Take hold of the tip of the board with your front hand and spot your landing. Hold on Maintain your position in the air and prepare to land. Stomp it Release the nose and level the board. Absorb the landing with your knees and ankles. Ninja tip Get your board close enough by imagining that you’re trying to knee yourself in the chest."
