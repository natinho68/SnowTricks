You know, if you get thicker tin foil and make sure your hat has absolutely no gaps the black helicopters will have more trouble reading your thoughts. I know, they told me."

It's as if folks have been in deep hibernation and only just awoke with NO knowledge of the damage caused by nose blunt and just accepting everything has got to change and is going to go wrong, badly, because a doomsday prophet has said so. A quick scan of the comments section has revealed some predictable gems."
